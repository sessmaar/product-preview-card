## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more with this challange than with any others, I used the mobile first approach and from there I was able to learn how to make the sizing, and use max or min width. Also I figured out how to create variables for the fonts as well wich was super helpful in the long run.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
/* Typography Preset */
/* Syntax: [font-weight] [font-size]/[line-height] [font-family] */
--text-preset-1: 700 2rem/100% var(--f-fraunces);
--text-preset-2: 700 0.875rem/ 110% var(--f-montserrat);
--text-preset-3: 500 0.875rem/ 160% var(--f-montserrat);
--text-preset-4: 500 0.75rem/ 120% var(--f-montserrat);
--text-preset-5: 500 0.8125rem/ 120% var(--f-montserrat);
```
